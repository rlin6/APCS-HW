    When I first came to Stuy, I really wanted to join a sports team to get myself into shape. Strangely enough, I ended up going for and getting into the Boys' Gymnastics Team. It was an amazing experience working together with other teammates to practice with and learn from. Joing the team was probably one of the best choices I made here. The image shows my speciality event, the pommel horse, and one of my favorite skills to aspire for: the Thomas flare/flair. </p>
