    A couple of friends of mine got me into volleyball. I usually just play this for fun during breaks with some people near my park. It's pretty fun and it's a hobby where I can actually interact with other people as part of the sport. The gif shows what's called a jump serve from a popular anime about volleyball that apparently everyone and their moms watched called Haikyuu.  </p>
