    Devil Survivor 2 is this new DS game I've been playing and it's really fun. It's an RPG involving training "demons" to fight others. While the gameplay is really good, what makes this game really shine is its story. It follows a story of humanity's last week and a struggle to survive. Additionally, there are many other characters whom you interact with that you can get closer to and learn more about their stories to unlock different routes in the story! Overall, it's a really good game and if you can't get this, get Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker for the 3DS where you unlock a whole new storyline!</p>
