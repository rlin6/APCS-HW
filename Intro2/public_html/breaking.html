    Breaking, breakdancing, bboying, are all names for this old-school type of hip-hop dancing. I got introduced to it through my teammates and I've been working on this when my season's not going on. But it's pretty hard, especially the dancing part of it. Not that good at it. But this gif shows a move I've been working on called windmills. </p>
