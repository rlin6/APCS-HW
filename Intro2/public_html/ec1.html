<header><center> Welcome to Digimon Pet Simulator!</center>
<p> Hello! This is the Digimon Pet Simulator! To begin, click the button down below and then pick your very first DigiEgg! After your egg has hatched, you will get to feed, play with, clean, heal, train, and battle with your Digimon. The first five actions affect their respective needs that must be kept at above 0 at all time. They will also add to your battle stats, which can be raised by training. Battling will match you against a random opponent and display the results to you. Winning will grant you more experience than losing and losing will decrease all your needs by a large amount. However, winning and training will also decrease those amounts by a small amount. You can tell you lost the battle if you lose 5+ points off of each needs. Once you fill up your experience, you will digi-evolve into the next stage. Aim for the final stage: Mega! Have fun!
