    Your Name, or Kimi no Na Wa, is an anime movie that I've seen recently that I would highly recommend to you all. Even though it's pretty "weeb", it's really popular in the US theaters where it's staying for a while (so hurry and go see it! English subbed of course).

    Pros <ul>
        <li> The handdrawn animation is BEAUTIFUL, see gif for reference. </li> 
        <li> The soundtrack is amazing and really adds onto the story</li>
        <li> It has a very emotional storyline dealing with issues that some teens like me deal with. You might cry, you might not, but the story is still really unique and interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p> <ul>
<li> Well it is anime so some people are really against it just because of that which is kinda sad.</li>
<li> The story can be confusing at first, romance a bit cheesy, and some plotholes but don't think too deep about the story and it should be good! Also, there's a lot of Eastern customs stuff that American viewers might not understand</li>
<li> It's not long enough!</li>
</ul>
