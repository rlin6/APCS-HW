    A Silent Voice/Koe no Katachi is another anime movie that's currently 2nd place behind Your Name in popularity. Sadly there's no English subbed yet so I'd like to push forth the original source material, the manga. Legends say that there's some issues in the school library but I have yet to check it out. Don't take it before I get a copy please. It's a deep story about bullying, disabilities, redemption, friendship, and suicide. It has really good character development and is also terribly depressing to read. But check it out! </p>
